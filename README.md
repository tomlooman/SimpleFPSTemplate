# Why creating a "simplified" FPS C++ Template?
The provided C++ template that ships with the engine has several features that someone new to C++ may not be interested in like VR controls and Touch input. This code "bloats" the template to look a lot more complex than necessary if you are simply looking to start with C++ in UE4. I'm using this project to create tutorials and you can use it in your own way!
